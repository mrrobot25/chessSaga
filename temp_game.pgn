1. e4 e6 {The French may not be very popular among the elite, but it's one of
the favorite defenses among amateurs, and it's always good to see it in action,
as it promises a complicated game. Ding had already played it in the match
against Nepomniachtchi at the suggestion of his second, GM Rapport. This move
certainly didn't come as a surprise to Gukesh.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 (3. Nd2 {is the
move played by Nepomniachtchi in the match.}) 3... Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 (5. Nce2
{Is the most common move order if White wants to play the plan with Nce2-c3.})
5... c5 6. Nce2 $5 (6. Nf3 {is by far the most played move.}) 6... Nc6 $1 (6...
cxd4 {is an attempt to exploit White's move order, but it seems that Black is
slightly worse after} 7. Nxd4 Nc6 8. Ngf3) 7. c3 {Now we have a transposition to
the main line of the system with Nce2 with thousands of games in the database.}
7... a5 $5 {Only the ninth most popular move in this position, but one of the
computer's favorites. Black wants to gain space on the queenside.} (7... Qb6 {is
the main move.}) (7... Be7 {is also natural and popular.}) (7... b5 {has the
plan of attacking on the queenside with b5-b4.}) (7... f6 {breaks in the center
immediately and can be studied.}) (7... cxd4 $6 {is weaker: it's too early to
release the tension.}) (7... f5 $6 {closes the kingside and allows White to try
a plan with g2-g4 later.}) (7... a6 $6 {too slow, I don't understand the point
of this move.}) (7... b6 $6 {one square too short.}) 8. Nf3 (8. a4 {can be
tried, stopping the advance of the black pawn, but then the inclusion of a5-a4
favors Black if he plays the conventional ideas with ...Qb6. After an exchange
on d4, it may be possible to take advantage of the weakened b4-square.} 8... Qb6
9. Nf3 Be7 10. g3 f6 {with double-edged play.}) 8... a4 9. Be3 (9. a3 {stops the
pawn but weakens the queenside a bit. Black is fine after} 9... Be7) 9... Be7
10. g4 $6 {A new move and somewhat dubious.} (10. Qd2 O-O 11. h4 $6
{Duda-Caruana, Chess.com Speed Chess blitz 2020. Here Black can get an advantage
with the typical} 11... f6 $1) (10. Ng3 Qb6 11. Rb1 cxd4 12. Nxd4 Bc5 {with a
balanced position, was played in Edwards-Guzman, email 2022.}) (10. dxc5 {is the
machine's recommendation.} 10... Nxc5 11. Ng3 $5 {with equal play} (11. Ned4 O-O
{transposes to Kamsky-Shabalov, USA-ch Saint Louis 2013.})) 10... Qa5 (10... O-O
{When in doubt, castle. This is a good move, too. If White follows development,
then after} 11. Bg2 b5 $1 {Black has excellent counterplay on the queenside.})
11. Bg2 (11. Kf2 $6 {Removes the king from the queen's action, but leaves the
monarch exposed after} 11... f6) (11. a3 {is possible, with complicated play
after} 11... f6) 11... a3 $6 {Apparently this is not the most accurate. Black
has several interesting alternatives.} (11... O-O) (11... b5 {with the idea of
playing b4.}) (11... Nb6 {in order to place the knight on c4.}) 12. b3 cxd4 13.
b4 $1 {An important intermediate move.} 13... Qc7 14. Nexd4 Nb6 {Black's knight
has the c4-square at its disposal, but White has a firm grip on d4 and Black's
queen is no longer so active.} 15. O-O (15. Nb5 {is interesting:} 15... Qd8 16.
Bf1 $5 {Preventing Nb6-c4. White can fight for a slight advantage.} (16. O-O {is
also possible, but here the position is equal after} 16... Nc4 17. Bf2 Bd7 18.
Nbd4)) 15... Nc4 16. Bf2 Bd7 17. Qe2 {A natural development move.} 17... Nxd4
18. Nxd4 (18. Bxd4 {is also playable, but after} 18... Bb5 {White has to solve
some problems due to the strong light-squared bishop, a piece that is usually a
burden in the French Defense but is very active in this position.}) 18... Nb2 $1
{An excellent move, attacking the pawn on c3 and also preparing Qc4 to activate
the queen or exchange it.} 19. Qe3 {Defending c3.} (19. f5 $6 {is an optimistic
pawn sac.} 19... Qxc3 {White has no compensation.}) (19. Nb5 {is natural but not
the best.} 19... Qc6 {with advantage for Black.} (19... Bxb5 20. Qxb5+ Qc6 {is
also good.})) (19. Rac1 Qc4 {forces a queen exchange.}) (19. Rfc1 {It's a pity
to remove the rook from the f-file. Black is fine after} 19... Qc4) 19... Rc8
20. Rac1 $6 {A natural reply, but there's a problem.} (20. Be1 $1 {This awkward
move is the most accurate. The idea is that after} 20... Qc4 $6 {White can now
play} 21. Rf3 $1 {preventing Qc4-d3.}) 20... Qc4 $1 {The a2-pawn is under
attack, but even more important is the fact that the queen invasion on d3 cannot
be stopped.} 21. f5 $6 {From now on White's position deteriorates quickly.} (21.
Rfe1 {is a bit better.} 21... Qd3 22. Bf1 Qxe3 23. Bxe3 Nc4 {with a comfortable
endgame for Black.}) 21... Qd3 $1 22. Qe1 $2 {This makes things even worse.}
(22. Qf4 {Here Black has the strong} 22... g5 $1 23. Qg3 (23. fxg6 $2 Qxg6 {is
horrible for White. The knight is jumping to d3, the bishop to g5, and the queen
attacks and defends on g6.}) 23... Qxg3 24. Bxg3 O-O {with the idea of Bd8-b6
and a better endgame.}) (22. g5 $5 {is a possible attempt to complicate the
game.}) 22... Bg5 $1 23. Rc2 Rc4 {Threatening to capture on d4.} 24. h4 (24. Qb1
{doesn't work:} 24... Rxc3 25. Rxc3 Qxc3 26. fxe6 fxe6 27. Bxd5 $5 {An
interesting practical try, but Black wins after precise play.} 27... exd5 28. e6
g6 $1 {A difficult move, preventing Qb1-f5.} (28... Ba4 $2 29. Qf5 $1 {with
counterplay.}) 29. exd7+ Kxd7 {Black is a pawn up with active pieces. The king
is surprisingly well-placed on d7.}) 24... Bf4 25. Qb1 {White is threatening
26.Rxb2.} 25... Rxc3 26. Rxc3 Qxc3 27. fxe6 fxe6 $2 {White gains some chances
now.} (27... Bxe6 $1 {is the best way to capture the pawn.} 28. Ne2 (28. Nb5
{loses after} 28... Qxe5 29. Re1 Bh2+ 30. Kh1 Qf4) 28... Qxe5 29. Nxf4 Qxf4
{with a winning position for Black.}) 28. Ne2 $1 Qxe5 29. Nxf4 Qxf4 30. Qc2 $2
{Right idea, wrong execution. This sentence is a cliche used by every chess
commentator.} (30. Bc5 $1 {is the right way.} 30... Qxg4 31. Qc2 $1 {Only now.
The position becomes very sharp. The queen can go to f2, to c3, or to c7 (after
a bishop move).} (31. Qxh7 $2 {This is very tempting, but Black wins after the
strong (and forced)} 31... Qd4+ $3 (31... Rxh7 32. Rf8#) 32. Bxd4 Rxh7) 31...
Na4 (31... Qxh4 $6 32. Qc3 $1 {and White gets real counterplay.}) (31... Nc4 {is
also possible:} 32. Qf2 Kd8 $1 33. Bb6+ Nxb6 34. Qxb6+ Ke8 35. Qd6 $1 Qd4+ 36.
Rf2 {with good drawing chances for White; his queen is very active.}) 32. Bd6
Qd4+ 33. Rf2 Nc3 $1 34. Bc5 Qd1+ 35. Qxd1 Nxd1 {Exchanging queens is a relief,
but now the a-pawn falls.} 36. Rf3 Nb2 37. Rxa3 Na4 {Black is a pawn up, but a
draw should be the correct result.}) 30... Qc4 $1 {Stopping the queen activity
and preparing to castle.} 31. Qd2 O-O $1 32. Bd4 Nd3 {Ding plays all the best
moves.} 33. Qe3 Rxf1+ (33... e5 {is also winning, but it's a bit more
complicated.} 34. Rxf8+ Kxf8 35. Bxe5 Nxe5 36. Qxe5 Qxb4) 34. Bxf1 e5 $1 {Here
it became clear to everyone that the game is over.} 35. Bxe5 (35. Bxd3 Qxd4 36.
Qxd4 exd4 {with an easy win in the bishop's endgame.}) 35... Qxg4+ 36. Bg2 (36.
Bg3 {is more stubborn, but Black is winning after} 36... Nxb4) 36... Bf5 $1 {The
bishop goes to e4.} 37. Bg3 {Played \"with the flag about to fall,\" an
expression that may seem difficult to understand in the age of digital chess
clocks.} 37... Be4 38. Kh2 h6 $1 (38... Bxg2 $4 {It's never too late to lose a
winning position.} 39. Qe8#) 39. Bh3 Qd1 40. Bd6 Qc2+ {Black simply goes after
the a2-pawn.} 41. Kg3 Qxa2 42. Be6+ Kh8 {A great game by Ding and a wonderful
start to the match.} (42... Kh7 $4 43. Qxe4+) (42... Kh8 43. Qxe4 Qf2+ $1) 0-1
